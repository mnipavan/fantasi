FANTASI framework for statistical modeling of NVMs

The FANTASI framework models the stochastic switching behaviors in MRAM and RRAM devices using the Fokker-Planck equation. Details of the simulation approach can be found in the following papers. Please kindly cite the following papers if you intend to use the FANTASI framework in your research:
